# K-Fold Pipeline
Utility for download, clean and serve different datasets organized by its purpose (classification or regression)

Data is split and organized in the ***/data/classification*** and ***/data/regression***. Each directory contains a *kaggle-repos.txt* file where the user can list the needed datasets for each line in the format `description: url`

Preloaded *Kaggle datasets URLs* are avaliable within this repository

### Kaggle token
In order to be able to download any kaggle dataset by the Python script, tue user must provide an username and the token generated by [Kaggle Webpage](https://www.kaggle.com/settings), in the API section.

    {"username":"USERNAME","key":"API_KEY"}

The easiest way to use this module is to provide the kaggle.json file generated previously into the project directory (at the same level that the `downloader.py` file)

    ./
	├── classification
	│   └── train-classification.py
	├── data
	│   ├── classification
	│   └── regression
	├── downloader.py
	├── kaggle.json			<==== THIS FILE
	├── README.md
	└── requirements.txt


In case the file is not provided, the script will explicitly ask the credentials for each dataset

### Download all datasets

    python downloader.py

### Python Environment

To activate and use the Virtual Environment (to aviod dealing with dependencies), run:

    $ source ./.venv/bin/activate
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
